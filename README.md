INTRODUCTION: This application was designed for a local luthier in the Nashville area who builds custom guitars for his clients.  

PURPOSE & MOTIVATION: The purpose of this project was to design a user friendly website where users could select from a list of available options to create a custom instrument.  The user send the completed guitar to the builder to begin construction.  This would make it easier for the luthier to recieve orders and communicate with clients more effectively.


HOW DOE THE APPLICATION WORK?:  The application works by utilizing select dropdowns for each guitar component which can be chosen by the user to construct a completed instrument.  When the selections are made, the user can browse a list of completed guitars in the "my guitars" page.  There, the user can search for guitars by name and sort by price.  The user then has the option to purchase the guitar or delete it.  When the "purchase guitar button is selected, the guitar will be posted in the administrators "New Orders" page.  



HOW WAS THE APPLICATION DEVELOPED?  The application was developed using React.js, HTML, and CSS.  
HOW TO INSTALL AND RUN THE APPLICATION? The application was designed to be run in the browser.  

DIFFICULTIES AND CHALLENGES: Learning and understanding how React uses state to create a dynamic website.  Styling with CSS proved challenging throughout the process.  


















# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
